KeepWiFiOn
==========

On OS X, if Wi-Fi gets turned off, then automatically turn it back on.

## What's the point of this?
Mac OS X Mavericks created a small problem for some users of antiquated MacBook Pros: when Wi-Fi gets turned off, the computer freezes within a few minutes.  Rebooting does not help, because upon boot, the computer checks the Wi-Fi state, sees that it's off, and freezes again.

KeepWiFiOn prevent your computer from freezing by

1. Turning Wi-Fi on automatically every time your computer boots
2. Monitoring the status of Wi-Fi during regular computer usage, and forcing Wi-Fi back on whenever it gets turned off

There is usually a delay of at least a couple seconds between turning Wi-Fi off and the computer freezing, so KeepWiFiOn should have enough time to get in there and save your computer.
